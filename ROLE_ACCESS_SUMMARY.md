# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System Fixes
- **AuthContext.jsx**: Fixed to properly store user data in localStorage and restore on app reload
- **Login functionality**: Now properly saves user role and authentication state
- **Persistent authentication**: User stays logged in across page refreshes

### 2. Dashboard Access Control
- **Teaching & Learning tile**: Only visible to authenticated users (admin/user roles)
- **Viewers**: Cannot see the Teaching & Learning tile at all
- **Visual feedback**: Alert shown when viewers try to access restricted content

### 3. Navbar Access Control
- **Templates link**: Only visible to authenticated users (admin/user roles)
- **Viewers**: Cannot see the Templates link in navigation
- **Role-based rendering**: Navigation adjusts based on user permissions

### 4. Page-Level Protection
- **Teaching & Learning page**: Redirects viewers to dashboard with access denied message
- **Templates page**: Redirects viewers to dashboard with access denied message
- **Route protection**: Pages check authentication status and role on load

### 5. UI Improvements
- **PDF preview windows**: Reduced size from 220px to 180px width, added height constraint (120px)
- **Landing page**: More compact PDF preview cards with better spacing
- **Responsive design**: Maintains good layout on different screen sizes

## User Roles & Permissions

### Viewer (Default for non-authenticated users)
- ✅ Can access: Dashboard (limited), Policy, About Us, Landing Page
- ❌ Cannot access: Teaching & Learning, Templates
- ❌ Cannot see: Teaching & Learning tile, Templates nav link

### User (Authenticated regular users)
- ✅ Can access: All pages including Teaching & Learning, Templates
- ✅ Can upload files: Only for assigned tasks
- ✅ File uploads: Require admin approval
- ✅ Can see: All navigation links and dashboard tiles

### Admin (Full access)
- ✅ Can access: All pages and features
- ✅ Can upload files: Direct approval, no waiting
- ✅ Can delete files: Full file management
- ✅ Can manage: Tasks, approvals, user roles

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Create Test Users
Run this command in the server directory:
```bash
cd server
node create-test-users.js
```

This creates:
- Admin: admin@test.com / admin123
- User: user@test.com / user123  
- Viewer: viewer@test.com / viewer123

### 2. Test Scenarios

#### As Viewer (or not logged in):
1. Visit dashboard - should NOT see "Teaching and Learning" tile
2. Check navbar - should NOT see "Template" link
3. Try accessing `/teaching-and-learning` directly - should redirect with alert
4. Try accessing `/template` directly - should redirect with alert

#### As User:
1. Login with user@test.com / user123
2. Visit dashboard - should see "Teaching and Learning" tile
3. Check navbar - should see "Template" link
4. Access Teaching & Learning page - should work
5. Access Template page - should work
6. Try uploading files - should require task assignment

#### As Admin:
1. Login with admin@test.com / admin123
2. Full access to all features
3. Can upload files directly (auto-approved)
4. Can delete files
5. Can manage all content

### 3. Expected Behavior

- **Navigation adapts** based on user role
- **Dashboard tiles hide/show** based on permissions
- **Page redirects work** for unauthorized access
- **Alerts show** appropriate messages
- **File upload behavior** varies by role
- **Authentication persists** across page refreshes

## Debug Information

The components now include console.log statements to help debug authentication:
- Check browser console for auth status messages
- Verify localStorage contains 'user' and 'token' after login
- Role changes should be reflected immediately in UI

## Files Modified

1. `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Authentication persistence
2. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Role-based tile visibility
3. `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Role-based navigation
4. `src/pages/TeachingAndLearning.jsx` - Page protection + better auth
5. `src/pages/Template.jsx` - Page protection
6. `src/pages/Landing.jsx` - Reduced PDF preview sizes
7. `server/routes/auth.js` - Admin user creation endpoints
8. `server/create-test-users.js` - Test user creation script

## Security Features

- **Client-side protection**: UI elements hidden based on role
- **Page-level protection**: Routes redirect unauthorized users
- **Authentication persistence**: Secure localStorage usage
- **Role validation**: Multiple layers of role checking
- **Access control**: Both visual and functional restrictions
